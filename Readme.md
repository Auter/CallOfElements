**This is a fork of MarcelineVQ's Call of Elements, extended with a smart
healing module. The addon provides comprehensive Shaman tools
including totem management, intelligent healing assistance, accessibility, and quality-of-life features.**

This fork was originally  created to support handheld / controller users, it now functions fully on PC.

NOTE: This addon is a work in progress. Features may change, and some rough
edges remain. Feedback and bug reports are welcome.

Designed for Vanilla 1.12 clients, with optional support for:
  - HealComm-1.0 (incoming heals awareness to avoid overhealing)
  - SuperWoW (chain heal logic, line-of-sight, and position checking)

**Extract the archive
